# ICS4U CPT: Three Point Shooters 2021-2022 Season
The data that is used are from some of the best three point shooters in the NBA. It takes in to account three point attempts, three point makes and three point percent. These data points were all taken from the 2021-2022 season. I selected this data set for the project because I believe that it is interesting to see how the information looks when they are graphed out. Seeing how the numbers are compared can allow you to get a better understand of why some of the elite shooters in the NBA are far and beyond some of the more average shooters.
